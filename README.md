# treehouse-courses
A repo to hold lessons and projects originated from teamtreehouse.com


This repo is designed to be a holding place for the files for the courses on teamtreehouse.com. All of the projects in this repo are projects designed by the staff at teamtreehouse.com for the purpose of teaching others. Subsequently, the files, projects, and ideas within this repo are not my own. 


There will be files in this repo that are either incomplete or have been upon once the course was completed. Additionally, courses and projects get updated as new features and tech evolves so the files within this repo may be out of date. 

### Courses Completed in this Repo

**Building Applications with React and Redux** | Completed Sept. 17, 2017
